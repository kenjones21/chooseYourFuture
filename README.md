# Choose Your Future
Choose your future is an interactive to explore carbon
budgets, climate policy, and risk.

[Soft climate denial](http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2016/09/living-web-soft-climate-denial.html)
is somewhat pervasive in our society; one need only look at [opinion polls](http://news.gallup.com/poll/206030/global-warming-concern-three-decade-high.aspx)
to realize that there is a significant discrepancy between people who purportedly
believe the science but do not respond rationally to its findings; the science lays
out quite clearly that the risk is existential for many people and places around the world,
and the result of continued inaction on climate change may indeed render organized life
difficult or impossible. I believe carbon budgets are a good tool one can use to plainly
demonstrate that we are out of time to act on climate, and hopefully clearly demonstrate
the urgency this issue demands.

This interactive is based largely on research compiled by the IPCC in the AR5 Synthesis
Report and the accompanying scenario database.
