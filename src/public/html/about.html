      Climate denial in the US unfortunately still has a large hold over a significant
      portion of the electorate. But perhaps an even bigger challenge than outright denial of
      the science is the

      which seems to be pervasive in our society. I believe that carbon budgets are an
      effective tool to combat this sort of soft denial, and they clearly indicate that
      we are out of time to act on climate change, if we are to avoid the very worst of
      its effects, and thus climate change constitutes an existential emergency we must
      respond to as fast as possible.

      The interactive attempts to demonstrate causality between our emissions and
      the risks of large temperature rises and impacts. Most materials on this do not do an
      adequate job of demonstrating risk; a single temperature or a range of temperatures
      accompanies a scenario. But it is at least as important to mention the risk of
      catastrophe. To use an analogy, consider a particularly dangerous plane trip. Which
      information is more important: that on average, the plane won't crash, or that there's
      nonetheless a 15% chance of the plane not landing safely?
