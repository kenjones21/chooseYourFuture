    <p>
      Carbon budgets in this document are based primarily on the budgets laid out in
      <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf"
	 target="_blank">
	Table 2.2 of the AR5 Synthesis report.
      </a>
      This table was used to create the divisions in the emissions pathway chart as well as the
      temperature corresponding to a 33% chance of exceedance. This was done by noting that the
      carbon budgets for various temperatures are linear (given the same probability of
      exceeding said temperature). This relationship may not hold at temperatures too far beyond
      3 degrees Celsius. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      However, it was not possible to use this table to inform probabilities of exceedance for
      intermediate levels of emissions. To create this, the
      <a href="https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/AR5DB/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about" target="_blank">
	AR5 scenario database
      </a>
      was used. In the database, probabilities of exceedance are given for 1.5, 2, 3, and 4
      degrees Celsius across model runs, using the reduced complexity
      <a href="http://wiki.magicc.org/index.php?title=Model_Description" target="_blank">
	MAGICC6
      </a>
      model.
      It is possible to compare cumulative carbon dioxide
      emissions to 2100 and probabilities of exceedance at the same date.
    </p>

    <p>
      Initially, a smooth fit across the four temperatures was attempted, using LOWESS regression.
      However, because the data includes a wide range of scenarios at certain stabilization levels,
      the smoothing behavior tended to be strange (and arguably unphysical) in these areas.
      To rectify this, an assumption was made that the probability distribution function for
      the amount
      of cumulative emissions necessary to exceed a certain temperature threshold was normally
      distributed, so the data as given could be fit to the integral of a Gaussian.
      The two fits generally agree with one another pretty well. Perhaps the most important
      discrepancy is at low levels of exceedance of 4 degrees Celsius, where the Gaussian fit
      is somewhat larger than the LOWESS fit.

    The stats for impact by degree were pulled from a
    <a href="http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/booklets/warming_world_final.pdf"
       target="_blank">
      report</a>
    based on another report from the National Research Council. Beyond the regimes specified
    in the report, the stat is specified as unknown. The temperature used to generate the stats
    is the temperature corresponding to a 33% probability of exceedance. An alternative might
    have been to pick the median temperature, but the 33% temperature was chosen to be more
    representative of the damages one might expect, given that the second derivative of most
    damage functions with respect to temperature is positive for temperatures less than six
    degrees, and for some damage functions (DICE), every temperature.
    For instance, if one considers a damage function of the
    form given by
    <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/11315435/GHG_Targets_Insurance.pdf?sequence=3"
       target="_blank">
      Weitzman (2010)</a>
    and a normally distributed PDF, the temperature representing the average damage is actually
    a little over a tenth of a degree higher than the mean temperature increase.

    </figure>

    <p>
      More qualitatively, it's arguably more important to communicate tail risks than
      the median case. The 33% chance of exceedance was chosen specifically because it
      is listed concretely in the AR5 Synthesis Report, and thus comes from a more authoritative
      source than the analysis done specifically for this interactive.
