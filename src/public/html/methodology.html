    <p>
      Carbon budgets in this document are based primarily on the budgets laid out in
      <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf"
	 target="_blank">
	Table 2.2 of the AR5 Synthesis report.
      </a>
      This table was used to create the divisions in the emissions pathway chart as well as the
      temperature corresponding to a 33% chance of exceedance.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was not possible to use this table to inform probabilities of exceedance for
      intermediate levels of emissions. To create this, the
      <a href="https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/AR5DB/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about" target="_blank">
	AR5 scenario database
      </a>
      was used. In the database, probabilities of exceedance are given for 1.5, 2, 3, and 4
      degrees Celsius across model runs. It is possible to compare cumulative carbon dioxide
      emissions to 2100 and probabilities of exceedance at the same date. Thus, the budgets
      that one might make from this analysis would be

	Threshold Exceedance Budgets,
      </a>
      as opposed to Threshold Avoidance Budgets, which would be smaller.

      Initially, a smooth fit across the four temperatures was attempted, using LOWESS regression.
      However, because the data includes a wide range of scenarios at certain stabilization levels,
      the smoothing behavior tended to be strange (and arguably unphysical) in these areas.

    <p>
      To rectify this, an assumption was made that the probability distribution function for
      the amount
      of cumulative emissions necessary to exceed a certain temperature threshold was normally
      distributed, so the data as given could be fit to the integral of a gaussian.

      The two fits generally agree with one another pretty well. Perhaps the most important
      discrepancy is at low levels of exceedance of 4 degrees Celsius, where the Gaussian fit
      is somewhat larger than the LOWESS fit.
