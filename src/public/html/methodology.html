  Budgets in this document are based primarily on the budgets laid out in
  <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf">
    Table 2.2 of the AR5 Synthesis report.
  </a>
  This table was used to create the divisions in the emissions pathway chart as well as the
  temperature corresponding to a 33% chance of exceedance.
</p>
<p>
  However, it was not possible to use this table to inform probabilities of exceedance for
  intermediate levels of emissions. To create this, the
  <a href="https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/AR5DB/dsd?Action=htmlpage&page=about">
    AR5 scenario database
  </a>
  was used. In the database, probabilities of exceedance are given for 1.5, 2, 3, and 4
  degrees Celsius across model runs. It is possible to compare cumulative emissions to
  2100 and probabilities of exceedance.

  Initially, a smooth fit across the four temperatures was attempted, using Loess regression.
  However, because the data includes a wide range of scenarios at certain stabilization levels,
  the smoothing behavior tended to be strange (and arguably unphysical) in certain areas.

  To rectify this, an assumption was made that the probability distribution function for the amount
  of cumulative emissions necessary to exceed a certain temperature threshold was normally
  distributed, so the data as given could be fit to the integral of a gaussian.
